  ### Problem 001
  Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
  For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

  ### Problem 002
  Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
  For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
  Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

  ### Problem 004
  Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in   the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
  For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.
  You can modify the input array in-place.

  ### Problem 007
  Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
  For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.
  You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.

  ### Problem 009
  Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.
  For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

  ### Problem 011
  Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.
  For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].
  Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.

  ### Problem 012
  There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. 
  Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

  ### Problem 013
  Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
  For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".
